# Auto Organize Sequence

Blender add-on to automatically clean up the sequence.

NB. This script has not been battle-tested so run it only on a VSE sequence in a full scene copy of your original VSE edit sequence. 

## Concentrate Sequence
Concentrate sequence by moving strips down while preserving their vertical order and restoring channel naming.

## Categorize Sequence
Group strips according to their types and rename the channel headers accordingly.
Useful for preparing a timeline for EDL export: https://github.com/tin2tin/ExportEDL

Warning: If the vertical order of the strips is important, this function shouldn't be used.

## Combined
Concentrate all sound strips below, and above categorize and concentrate everything else.
