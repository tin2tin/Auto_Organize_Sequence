# Arrange Sequence

Blender add-on to automatic clean up the sequence.

## Concentrate Sequence
Concentrate sequence by moving strips down while preserving their vertical order and restore channel naming.

## Categorize Sequence
Group strip according to their types and rename the channel headers accordingly.
Useful for preparing timeline for EDL export: https://github.com/tin2tin/ExportEDL

Warning: If the vertical order of the strips is important, this function shouldn't be used.

## Combined
Collect all sound strips in the bottom with categorize and concentrate everything else above.
